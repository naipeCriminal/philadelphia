======================


Welcome to the Advance Login Style Github repository
----------------------------------------------

While the documenation for the [Advanced Login Style plugin](https://pluginsbazaar.com/plugins/advanced-login-style/) can be found on pluginsbazaar.com, here
you can browse the source of the project, find and discuss open issues and even
[contribute yourself](https://github.com/pluginsbazaar/advance-login-style/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Installation
------------

Here's a [guide on how to install Advance Login Style in your WordPress site](https://pluginsbazaar.com/plugins/advanced-login-style/installation/).
If you want to run the Git version though, you have two options:

* You can clone the GitHub repository: https://github.com/pluginsbazaar/advance-login-style.git
* Downloading it directly unfortunately won't work as the .zip file doesn't contain the submodules.

This will download the latest development version of Advance Login Style By Plugins Bazaar. While this version is usually stable,
it is not recommended for use in a production environment.
